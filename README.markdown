Newt Serif is a soft, friendly serif font that has been described as appearing
to have been “drawn by the light of mystic moons.” It did take many moons to
finish (being my first finished font), so maybe some of them were mystic. 

Newt Serif has a strong calligraphic bent and a healthy dose of whimsy. The
italics are of a freer spirit than the romans, and include a few intriguingly
shaped letters (for example: *E*, *g*, *s*, and *y*). While the font is
light-hearted, it’s still a fairly “typographically-minded” serif, comfortable
enough for longer passages of text.

## Installing

Download the ZIP of all the files:

[NewtComplete.zip](https://github.com/chuckmasterson/newt-serif/raw/master/NewtComplete.zip)

Extract it, and you've got .otf files, which your computer should be able to
make sense of. Install it in whatever way you normally install fonts.

## Developing

You can choose from .ufo files or .otf files; they're both here. Be aware that
I haven't done any work on this font in many years, and the .ufo files were
automatically generated by FontForge.

Don't let the scent of abandonware scare you off, though; I'm proud of this
font and it hasn't decayed since I finished it. There are no pictures as of
yet, but I expect to have a chance to put some up soon.
