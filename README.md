# Newt Serif

Made by Looseleaf Fonts. This is now open source, but I haven't done any research on what license I want to use, so that's not here.

## Installing

Download the ZIP of all the files:

[NewtComplete.zip](https://github.com/chuckmasterson/newt-serif/raw/master/NewtComplete.zip)

Extract it, and you've got .otf files, which your computer should be able to make sense of. Install it in whatever way you normally install fonts.
